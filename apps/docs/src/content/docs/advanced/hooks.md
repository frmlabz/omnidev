Hooks are planned for a future OmniDev release. They will let capabilities run custom scripts before or after specific operations.

## Status

This feature is not yet available. Track progress in the project roadmap and release notes.

## Intended use cases

- Validate configuration before `omnidev sync`
- Run setup scripts during initialization
- Enforce policies after provider files are generated
