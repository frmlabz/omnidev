# The missing package manager for AI coding capabilities

OmniDev is a package manager for AI coding capabilities (skills, rules, prompts, hooks, MCP servers). Wrap a GitHub repo or local folder into a versioned capability, then use it across tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, …).

- **Wrap anything** — Point to any GitHub repo or local folder containing skills/rules/prompts and OmniDev wraps it into a capability
- **One config, all tools** — Configure once via `omni.toml`, then generate provider-specific files
- **Profile switching** — Load different capability sets for frontend, backend, planning, etc.
- **Full-featured** — Capabilities can contain skills, rules, commands, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers
- **Capability-local templating** — Use a gitignored capability `.env` to parameterize MCP config and skill content

> Status: **alpha** — breaking changes may occur while features settle.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @omnidev-ai/cli

# Initialize in your project
omnidev init

# Add a capability from GitHub
omnidev add cap my-tools --github user/repo

# Check everything is working
omnidev doctor
```

This creates an `omni.toml` configuration file and `.omni/` directory with your capabilities.

## Provider Support

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor | Codex | OpenCode |
|---------|:-----------:|:------:|:-----:|:--------:|
| **Skills** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Agents** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Commands** | ✅* | ✅ | ✅* | ✅ |
| **Hooks** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Rules** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **MCP Servers** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Notes:**

- **Claude Code & Codex Commands**: Merged into skills (these providers don't have native commands concept)
- **Codex MCP**: Supports `stdio` and `http` transports only (SSE skipped with warning)

## What Can OmniDev Do?

### Manage Capabilities

Install reusable AI capabilities from GitHub or local directories:

```bash
omnidev add cap obsidian --github kepano/obsidian-skills
omnidev add cap my-local --local ./capabilities/custom
```

### Claude Plugin Wrapping

OmniDev can auto-wrap existing `.claude-plugin` directories as capabilities. Point to a repo with a `.claude-plugin/` folder and OmniDev handles the rest—including `hooks.json` parsing and path variable resolution (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` → absolute paths).

### Switch Profiles

Use different capability sets for different contexts:

```bash
omnidev profile set frontend   # Load UI/accessibility tools
omnidev profile set backend    # Load database/API tools
```

### Add MCP Servers

Integrate Model Context Protocol servers:

```bash
omnidev add mcp filesystem --command npx --args "-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path"
```

MCP-only environment variables can be set in `omni.toml` with `env = { KEY = "value" }` under `[mcps.<name>]` or via `omnidev add mcp --env KEY=value`.

### Unified Project Instructions

Define your project instructions in `OMNI.md` and OmniDev generates provider-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) automatically.

## Why OmniDev?

Every AI coding tool reinvents the wheel—different folder structures (`.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.agent/`), different config formats, and they can't even agree on whether it's "skill" or "skills". This makes it painful to share setups with your team or switch between tools.

But it's not just about config locations. **It's also about context.** AI agents work better with focused, task-specific context. You don't want to load database tools when working on UI, or vice versa. Switching between different configurations of hooks, agents, skills, and commands depending on your task is verbose and often ends up as manual work or ad-hoc scripts.
